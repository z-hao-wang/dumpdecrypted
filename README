First adjust the Makefile if you have a different iOS SDK installed.

And then just: make


Usage:

You MUST edit dumpdecrypted.c file before make
You need to manually find the application data path in /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/XXXX
After editing dumpdecrypted.c file
```make
scp dumpdecrypted.dylib root@192.168.1.106:/var/root
```
Then ssh to iphone
```
